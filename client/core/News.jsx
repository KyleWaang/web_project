        Known Issues:

        Lynn

        Common
        After the game update on July 16, 2025, some players were unable to open the Compensation Box that was distributed on June 20, 2025. We are currently investigating this issue and will provide an update at a later time.
        Challenger World - Interactive
        Karma Bright Cubes obtained from the Morning Star Feast are not able to select the "AFTER" Potential stat when used.
        Resolved Issues:

        July 17, 2025
        Resolved an issue where Kanna's HEXA Nightghost Guide passive effect incorrectly increased the damage of all skills instead of only Kishin Shoukan.
        Resolved an issue where Kanna's HEXA enhanced Spirit's Domain skill would only reach Stage 2 instead of Stage 3.
        Resolved an issue where using Althea's Support skill during Ride or Die would sometimes cause players to disconnect from the game.
